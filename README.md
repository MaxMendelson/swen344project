#Student Enrollment System#

DEVELOPMENT

Any changes made to the code will automatically update in your development environment. First install dependencies with `npm install', then run the server with `gulp`, and navigate to `localhost:5000` to view the page.

TESTS

From the root directory, run `gulp tests` to run all jasmine unit tests. This refers to everything within the 'spec' directory. This can be nested and split into folders for organizational reasons, it doesn't all have to be in one file. BUT -- each file does need to have xxxx.spec.js at the end, not just xxxx.js!

#Some of the basic requirements include:#
Admins should be able to create/remove courses.
Basic rules should be enforced for each course. This may include a specific year level, or GPA (discuss specific requirements with your customer)
Courses should have wait lists
Students should be able to request special access services for a course.
When students register for a classroom, this information should be automatically sent to the facility management group and roster. You will need to work with the Facility Management group on this requirement.
External Connection

Each user may chhoose to link their account with Linked in. In that case, it will automatically bring in their LinkedIn photo, and other relevant information (to be discussed with customer)
